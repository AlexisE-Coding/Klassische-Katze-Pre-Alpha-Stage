# Klassische-Katze-Pre-Alpha-Stage
Klassische Katze's pre-alpha repo. Made primarily for making themes and ensuring basic functionalities, etc.


# What-is-Klassische-Katze?
It's "Classic Cat" in German, and the purpose is (ideally) to allow users to browse the web through pre-screened and pre-approved websites (both "official" by KK-Team in the MasterList, or community-generated through the sharable Personal Lists features).
It's (supposed to be) a glorified AllowList ("whitelist") to combine both old and new sensibilities for browsing the internet.. something that I personally think is needed given how SEO and Sponsorships have thoroughly made it downright user-hostile to find what you're actually looking for on the internet nowadays.
If KK works as intended, it will be the first of its kind, an end-user Domain Manager that you can use in-browser to both find new websites that should ideally be useful to you, as well as only pulling query requests from those sites on the Master/Personal List(s).
