Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this!

I'm Alexis Erinsspring, currently the only developer on this project.
The purpose of this note is to express gratitude towards the Klassische Katze Team!
The KK-Team is in charge of managing and updating the Klassische Katze files for people to download!

In keeping with the BSD 3-Clause license, anybody can use this code and modify and sell it to their heart's content!
-The only thing i'd like to ask is that you name it something other than Klassische Katze (or Classic Cat) and that you leave a note in your files (similar to this) explaining why you've decided to develop the core KK idea in your particular direction! (i'd be curious to know, and who knows, i might prefer yours anyways!)
